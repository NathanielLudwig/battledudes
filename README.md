Dungeongame / Battledudes: Dungeongame is a role playing game that was supposed to be my final project before it turned into Battledudes. The app features a level that the character can walk around in using directional buttons. The dude also has walking animations based on where he is pointing and collides with walls. My main take aways were being able to assign physics bodies to tiles by making invisible SKNodes on tiles and using SKactions to animate the dude while he is walking.
